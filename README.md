# VI Assignment 1 - Primeira Liga

## Description

This React based application using D3.js and Material UI allows the user to visualize statistics about the Portuguese
Primeira Liga football championship from the 2017/18 season to the 2022/23 season. The user is able to select the
season to analyse, and choose which teams to compare. Some of the used visualization techniques include:

- **Line Chart:** Shows the evolution of the selected teams' points throughout the season.
- **Parallel Coordinates Chart:** Correlates the selected teams' position, points, number of wins, number of losses and
  number of draws.
- **Bar Chart:** Shows the total and per match-day stats of the selected teams, in all matches or home/away matches. Stats
  include the number of goals scored, goals conceded, shots, shots (on target), corners, fouls, yellow cards and red
  cards.

**Deployment:** [Primeira Liga @ GitHub](https://joaompfonseca.github.io/vi-primeira-liga/)
